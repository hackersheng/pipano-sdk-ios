## Basic Usage

### 1.Import Headers

Import the framework main Header file `PiPanoSDK.h`

```objective-c
#import <PiPanoSDKComplete/PiPanoSDK.h>
```



### 2.Get PiPano Camera View

Call method `getCameraView` to get the camera View. PiPano will render the panorama in this View, and also  with some input operations.

```objective-c
UIView* piCameraView = [PiPano getCameraView];

//put cameraView into a father view
[superPICameraView setBounds:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
[superPICameraView addSubview:piCameraView];
```



### 3.On Ready Event

PiPano initialization takes a bit of time. After completion, there will be a block callback. Sample code:

```objective-c
[PiPano onPiPanoSDKReady:^()
{
   NSLog(@"SDK is ok !");
}];
```



### 4.Browse panorama image&video

Call method `openPhoto` to browse panorama image. Sample code:

```objective-c
- (void)openPhoto:(id)sender
{
    NSString* photoPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"testRes/one_eye_image" ofType:@"jpg"];
    [PiPano openPhoto:photoPath sourceMode: PISM_OneEye];
}
```



Call method `openVideo` to browse panorama image. Sample code:

```objective-c
- (void)openPhoto:(id)sender
{
    NSString* videoPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"testRes/two_eye_video" ofType:@"mp4"];
    [PiPano openVideo:videoPath  sourceMode: PISM_TwoEye];
}
```
